        <p>Celebrating a milestone like an anniversary, a birthday, or a great set of grades can give us an amazing
            feeling. And it can be even better when someone else notices our achievements and makes the effort to
            acknowledge them. If you celebrate achievement in the right way, you'll likely increase confidence and
            motivation, leading to happier and more productive teams. If you rarely acknowledge a job well done (or you
            celebrate in a way that feels forced, unfair or inappropriate) there's a risk that morale and dedication
            will slip away.</p>
